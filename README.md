# Project 1: Databases - XP

**Link to the website:**
https://gaxp.herokuapp.com

The Problem: New students (starting at GA) crave the valuable insights from the experienced students.â€¨
However, this wealth of knowledge lost as the student turn over cycle means that as one class starts, another is finishing

My Solution: I wanted to create a forum/twitter/slack/memepage that could hold information, A Community knowledge base of Tools, Tips, and Experiences from the General Assembly.

This website was built using Ruby on Rails and also uses Bootstrap and hosting by Heroku.

## Crud Mapping:

## Challenges:
- Understanding the crud system and troubleshooting. I think it helps to break it down as the triangle of Routes, Controllers, Views.
- Time Management - I think I need to better work on my time management so that I actually spend more time making the product than just planning and making it look nice. I also found that actually getting started enabled you to solve a lot of issues that you can have in planning.


## Lessons learnt:
- Don't have to always have to code something in. Sometimes, it is nice to keep it clean or have as feature shown visually.
- Bootstrap is pretty amazing! - good idea to follow a simple and easy to understand naming system.
- Again the importance of usability and keeping in mind the user base.
