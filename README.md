The Problem: New students (starting at GA) crave the valuable insights from the experienced students.â€¨
However, this wealth of knowledge lost as the student turn over cycle means that as one class starts, another is finishing

My Solution: I wanted to create a forum/twitter/slack/memepage that could hold information, A Community knowledge base of Tools, Tips, and Experiences from the General Assembly.

XP stands for Experience. In gaming terms it also stands for Experience Points. By using XP I am refering to both of these.

This website was built using Ruby on Rails. It also uses Bootstrap for CSS and Heroku for hosting.

## Features:
- Tells you if poster is student, alumni, staff or outcomes
- Date created, date updated for information validity
- Highlights classmates' posts in Red
- Highlights own post in Green
- Points system for post credibility - more points means information provided by user has helped more people!
- Uses styling reference from GA brand guidelines
- Easy to use design.

## Crud Mapping:

## Challenges:
- Understanding the crud system and troubleshooting. I think it helps to break it down as the triangle of Routes, Controllers, Views.
- Time Management - I think I need to better work on my time management so that I actually spend more time making the product than just planning and making it look nice. I also found that actually getting started enabled you to solve a lot of issues that you can have in planning.


## Lessons learnt:
- Don't have to always have to code something in. Sometimes, it is nice to keep it clean or have as feature shown visually.
- Bootstrap is pretty amazing! - good idea to follow a simple and easy to understand naming system.
- Again the importance of usability and keeping in mind the user base.
